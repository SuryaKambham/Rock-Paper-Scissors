This is project I have made by following Tech With Tim's "Python Online Game Tutorial" Series. 
This project allows a person on any kind of laptop to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with another person on another device.
The only restriction on the game is that both laptops need to be connected to the same internet.
Other than that the game will neatly organize devices into games with two people each, there is even a waiting screen when you are waiting for another player to connect.
